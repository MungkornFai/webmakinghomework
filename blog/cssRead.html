            CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
             Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

            <h2>Who create css</h2>
            CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group.
             The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications.
              When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.
            These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language.
             Independent companies and organizations create that software.
